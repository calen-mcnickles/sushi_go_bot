A bot that plays [Sushi go](https://www.miniclip.com/games/sushi-go-round/en/#) and can be adapted to other web games.

It took some tinkering, googling and updating for me to get this to work just right. 

This was my first foray into creating a bot and a big thanks to Chris Kiehl for making this [How to Build a Python Bot That Can Play Web Games](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-python-bot-that-can-play-web-games--active-11117) tutorial.

Pretty amazing that a 2012 tutorial can still be so informative and helpful 9 years later.

Good luck beating my score!
